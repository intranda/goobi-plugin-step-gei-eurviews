          The author divides humanity into yellow, black and white races. Only the history of the white race is of interest. This is identified by the author as being the most intelligent and most capable of progress. Their superiority explaining the dominance of the white race in the world. With reference to the bible and to academic findings he states that the white race descended from the three sons of Noah. The Semites, i.e. Jews and Arabs, can be traced back to Shem; the inhabitants of ancient Egypt to Ham. Japheth was the forefather of the Indo-European race, also known as Aryans or Caucasians. These were the

          Until relations with China allow us to know that country better, we cannot include its

          <hi rend="bold">8. White race</hi>
          – The white race is so superior to others in terms of
          intelligence that in reality it is the race that dominates the majority of the world. The
          bible, the religious book of the Jews and Christians is the oldest document we have about
          the earliest ages. It links all history with that of the Hebrew people and only speaks of
          those peoples that are descended from the white races, that is to say the descendants of
          the three sons of Noah:
          <hi rend="italic">Shem, Ham</hi>
          y
          <hi rend="italic">Japheth.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>
          Academia has preserved these names: The
          <hi rend="bold">Semites</hi>
          are represented by
          the
          <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi>
          and
          <hi rend="italic">Arabs</hi>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <hi rend="bold">Hamites</hi>
          soon moved to Africa and formed the populations of
          ancient Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly the family of
          <hi rend="bold">Japheth</hi>
          covered parts of Asia, as well as
          Persia and Armenia and spread into Europe through the Caucuses; which is why this, the
          most pure of the white races, is frequently known as
          <hi rend="italic">Caucasian</hi>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">9. The Aryans; the Indo-European race.</hi>
          – Modern academia identifies
          the family of Japheth particularly as
          <hi rend="bold">Aryans</hi>
          .
        </p>
        <p>The Aryans settled initially in the high mountains of Asia and subsequently divided into
          many branches which went in different directions.</p>
        <p>
          One of these branches headed towards the west, and to Europe: these are the
          <hi rend="italic">Iranians</hi>
          , from whom we are descended; another went down to the
          Ganges valley: they are the
          <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing the languages spoken along the Seine or the Tiber with those spoken on the
          banks of the Ganges, scholars have shown that European languages are closely related to
          <hi rend="italic">Sanskrit</hi>
          , the holy language of India and that a
          <hi rend="italic">relationship therefore exists with the Indian race</hi>
          leading
        </p>
        <pb n="14" />
        <p>
          to the name
          <hi rend="bold">Indo-European</hi>
          race for the European families.
